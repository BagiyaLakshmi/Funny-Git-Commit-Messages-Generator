Made a typo in the last commit message
Accidentally committed my to-do list instead of code
Left a funny joke in the code as a Easter egg
Whoops, forgot to add the changes
Fixed the bug that was causing all the bugs
Committed a commit to fix the previous commit
Added the missing semicolon, finally
Changed all the variables to klingon
Refactored the code to be more DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself... or do, I don't care)
Changed all the variable names to characters from The Office
Turned the code upside down, just for fun
Accidentally committed my password, oops
